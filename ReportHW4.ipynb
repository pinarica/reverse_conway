With cmse2.txt after compilation the best case scenario that I found was with a fitness of 274, that means that on iteration `./gol < serial_best.txt` there are only 274 differences between serial_best.txt and cmse2.txt. Out of 2500 points one would think that this is great, this amounts to 89% similarity, however to the human observer this is not even an appealing solution due to the fact that (as we can see below) we can't figure out any words or shapes, this is due to the fact that the plate is mostly 0's and answers would gravitate to favoring solutions with basically blank plates since there are so few 1's. I think this points to how the muate rate was coded, since answers that are really good are mutated at a lower rate, we can see that here on lines 71-82.\n",
